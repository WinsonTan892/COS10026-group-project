          <h2>CSS enhancements - Link Highlighting, Animations, Progress Bar</h2>
          <p>The :hover pseudo-class is used to define the style for links when the user hovers over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS link highlighting is considered advanced and beneficial because it improves the usability and accessibility of a website. By providing visual cues to users about the state of links, it helps them understand where they currently are in the website and where they can go next.</li>

	    <li>CSS Animations help direct the user's focus onto the important elements on a webpage whilst also making it more lively. This results in a more coherent and entertaining experience.</li>
	    <li> In order to implement animations into the webpage, the @keyframes rule is used. This rule determines the animation style at a given point in time, where the animation begins with a 'from' keyframe and ends with a 'to' keyframe. This allows sections of a webpage to change opacity, slide left to right and vice versa.
